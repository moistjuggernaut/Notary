General Requirements (All Ages)
Size and Dimensions: The photo must be 35mm x 45mm (width x height). The head, from the crown to the chin, should measure 31-36mm, which is approximately 70-80% of the photo's height. The face width, from ear to ear, should be 16-20mm.
Quality and Printing: The image must be a high-resolution color print on thin, photo-quality paper with a continuous tone, meaning there are no visible pixels or dots. It must be in sharp focus, undamaged, and free of any retouching, ink marks, or creases. The photo must be recent, taken within the last six months.
Lighting and Color: The lighting must be uniform and balanced to prevent shadows on the face or background. There should be no "hot spots" or glare, and the photo's color must be natural, with no red-eye or color casts.
Background: The background must be plain, light-colored (white, off-white, light grey, or light blue), and evenly illuminated with no shadows, patterns, or textures.
Pose and Head Position: The photo requires a full frontal view with the head centered, level, and facing the camera directly. Both edges of the face and the top of the shoulders must be visible.
Expression and Eyes: A neutral expression is required, with the mouth closed and no smiling or frowning. Eyes must be open, level, and clearly visible.
Attire and Accessories: Normal clothing is required. Prescription glasses are permitted if they are clear, thin-framed, and do not obscure the eyes or cause glare. Hats and head coverings are only allowed for religious or medical reasons, provided they do not cast shadows or hide the face. No hair or accessories should obscure the eyes.
Other: Only one person should be in the photo. Digitally captured images must comply with ISO/IEC 39794-5 standards for resolution and compression.

Requirements for Children and Infants 
Children (Ages 10+): These individuals are treated as adults and must comply fully with all the requirements listed above.
Children (Under 10): The general requirements apply, but some relaxations are permitted to account for the difficulty in getting a perfect pose.
Proportions: The head size may be slightly smaller than the 70–80% range.
Expression: A mildly relaxed expression is tolerated. The mouth may not be fully closed.
Head Position: Minor deviations in gaze or head tilt are allowed as long as the face is clear and generally frontal.
Infants (Under 1 Year): These are the most relaxed requirements.
Eyes and Mouth: The eyes do not need to be open (though it is preferred). The mouth may be slightly open.
Expression: A neutral expression is preferred but not strictly enforced.
Other: Head support is allowed as long as it is not visible in the final photo. The child must be the only person in the frame.
